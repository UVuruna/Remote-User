# Layouts

**Script:** [Layouts (script)](../layouts.js) ·
**Flow:** [diagram](../__flow/layouts.md)

## Purpose

The whole phone-side layout feature (Phase F+): the loading animation, the
top-center layout bar, the layout LIST, the per-layout ASPECT RATIO panel and
the creation flow (source chooser → slots → Create). Fifth of the seven client
scripts to load — after [Controls](controls.md) (whose `keepFocus`, `svg`,
`showToast` and `IN_APP` it uses), before [Gestures](gestures.md).

Split out of [Controls](controls.md) on 2026-08-03, when that file crossed THE
STRUCTURE LAW's 1,000 lines. The boundary is a responsibility one, not a size
one: `controls.js` drives the PC directly (keys, clicks, upload, quality),
everything here composes and frames WINDOWS on it.

## Connections

### Uses
- [State](state.md) — `send`, `layouts`, `layoutActive`, `layoutRegion`,
  `layoutArm`, `streamMode`, `baseBitmap`
- [Render](render.md) — the `<video>` element / `baseBitmap` as the frame
  source the settle watcher samples
- [Controls](controls.md) — `keepFocus`, `svg`, `showToast`, `IN_APP`

### Used by
- [Connection](connection.md) — `layout_state` → `settleLayLoading()`,
  `updateLayoutBar()`, `applyOrientationLock()`; `layout_offer` →
  `handleLayoutOffer()`; `layout_progress` → `cubeNext()`
- [Gestures](gestures.md) — the armed pick tap reads `layoutArm`
- [Window Manager](../../server/__about/window_manager.md) /
  [Web Layer](../../server/__about/web.md) — the other end of
  `layout_list` / `layout_create` / `layout_focus` / `layout_aspect` /
  `layout_remove`

## Key Functions & Data

- **Loading animation** — `showLayLoading(text)` / `settleLayLoading()` /
  `hideLayLoading()`, `cubeFrame`, `cubeNext`, `CUBE_VIEWS`. The overlay is
  opaque and covers the ENTIRE time a layout is created, loaded or switched;
  `layout_state` only arms the settle watcher (`settleStill` samples a 64×36
  thumbnail of the live frame), and the animation drops when the picture
  actually stops moving. Every showing opens on the next cube face.
- **Layout bar** — `updateLayoutBar`, `layoutStep(dir)`, `focusLayout(index)`
  (index −1 = full desktop), `applyOrientationLock` (drives the shell's
  `Android.lockOrientation`: layout focus = locked, desktop = free).
- **Layout list** — `openLayoutPicker`, `layRow`, `ratioLabel`: every layout
  at once (Desktop first), a row taps to focus, its trailing button opens the
  aspect panel.
- **Aspect panel** — `openAspectPanel`, `renderAspectPanel`,
  `updateAspectPreview`, `dragHandle`, `ratioPair`, `devicePair`: W : H fields
  over a dashed phone-screen preview with the region inside it. Nothing moves
  on the PC until Apply, which sends `layout_aspect {index, w, h}`.
- **Creation** — `openSourceChooser`, `armNextTap`, `handleLayoutOffer`,
  `renderCreationPanel`, `cancelCreation`, `slotFromOffer`/`slotFromEntry`,
  `GRID_CELLS`.

## Design Decisions

- **The overlay is the FRONT; the work happens behind it** (owner rule, said
  four times). It may fade out only when the layout window is in place and
  alone on screen — or, for Desktop, when every layout member is really
  minimized. Two ends must agree: the server now finishes for real before it
  answers (DWM transitions frozen + `wait_settled`/`wait_minimized` — see
  [Window Manager](../../server/__about/window_manager.md)), and this side
  waits `SETTLE_CATCHUP_MS` after the answer before it judges the picture at
  all. **That delay is the bug the owner saw twice:** sampling used to start
  the instant `layout_state` arrived, while the phone was still displaying the
  OLD frame (the encoder and the link run a few hundred ms behind the PC) — two
  identical samples of a STALE picture read as "settled", the cube left, and
  the frames showing the window rising arrived right after it.
- **The animation lasts until the SCREEN is right, not until the server
  answers** (owner, repeatedly, finally 2026-08-03). The server's
  `layout_state` arrives while Windows is still restoring windows from the
  taskbar and sliding them into their cells — the phone used to hide the
  overlay right then and the user watched the whole scramble. Now the overlay
  stays and a 64×36 thumbnail of the live frame is sampled every
  `SETTLE_SAMPLE_MS`; it drops after `SETTLE_STABLE_HITS` near-identical
  samples, `LOADING_MIN_MS` at the earliest, `SETTLE_MAX_MS` after the answer
  at the latest (unrelated motion on the PC — a playing video — must not hold
  it forever) and `LOADING_MAX_MS` if the server never answers at all.
  Sampling the frame source and NOT the canvas is deliberate: the canvas
  carries the layout view transform, which itself changes on focus.
- **A different cube angle every time** (owner 2026-08-03). `CUBE_VIEWS`
  holds one corner view per face in the owner's order (top → left → back →
  right → front → bottom, looping); each showing advances one step. Every
  entry is its face dead-on plus a ~30° tilt on both axes, so the cube still
  reads as a cube instead of a flat coloured square — the same reason the
  projection is orthographic (no `perspective`).
- **Enter and exit cross-fade** (owner 2026-08-03, "like the theme switch in
  Prompt Painter"): visibility is the `open` class with a CSS opacity
  transition, never the `hidden` attribute, and the cube keeps spinning
  through the fade-out — a frozen cube during the fade is exactly the stutter
  the smooth exit removes.
- **Arrows outside, name in a frame** (owner 2026-08-03): the old `‹ ›`
  glyphs sat inside the label and were too small to hit; they are now large
  SVG buttons on either side, and the framed name is its own button that
  opens the full list — stepping through a dozen layouts one by one to reach
  one was the reported pain.
- **The aspect ratio can only make the region SMALLER than the phone's own
  shape** (owner decision 2026-08-03): portrait keeps the phone's full width
  and only loses height, landscape keeps its height and only loses width. The
  panel therefore locks the pinned field and lets only the free one be typed
  or dragged, and the server clamps the same way — see
  [Window Manager](../../server/__about/window_manager.md).
- **W : H as small whole numbers**, not raw pixels: a phone's 412×892 reduces
  to 103:223, which is unusable in two number fields. `ratioPair` picks the
  best approximation with a denominator ≤ 40 (412×892 → 6:13, 1080×2400 →
  9:20). "Screen" resets the override entirely (`w = h = 0` on the wire), so
  an approximation error can never accumulate into a shrinking region.
